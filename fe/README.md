# CodePush KIT Tech Stack

- Typescript
- FE: Design Patter with Redux Toolkit / reflect-metadata / typedi / class-transformer / class-validator
- BE: NestJS / PostgreSQL

## Installing step by step

In the project directory, I do not enoght time to deploy and build on PRODUCTION or any free Cloud. Please review me another day when I have more time to do that:
- BE:
### `yarn`
### `yarn start:dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- FE

### `yarn`
### `yarn start`

You should say Yes to open another port which is different with 3000 (was consumed by BE). I also open CORS for client at PORT: 8080, 3001, 3002 & 3003 at localhost,

ENJOY!
